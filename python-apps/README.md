## Python Apps

### [BCPy2000 Modules](https://github.com/cboulay/EERAT/tree/master/python-apps/BCPy2000)

Modules for use with BCPy2000 to store data in and interact with EERAT.

### [Online Analysis](https://github.com/cboulay/EERAT/tree/master/python-apps/online-analysis)

Modules for performing very specific analyses of EERAT data that are useful for obtaining information about the data in real-time.
Real-time typically means:

* single-subject
* small(ish) subsets of data
* not knowing the distribution of your entire set (and therefore not eliminating outliers)
